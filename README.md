# Script Toolkit

You can add all the scripts in this toolkit to your path by running this `export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)` or adding this path to your ~/bash_profile file.

## Git

`repo-states.sh` - gives the git status of each subdirectory from where you are. You can add it as an alias so you can just run `repos` anywhere, by running this, `alias repos='./repo-states.sh'`
